# SpecialCharacters.ahk
This is the <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> script I use to type common special characters, including Spanish accented letters, superscripts, math and science symbols. I've also included shortcuts to simulate the media control keys.

You can copy and paste the script, or <a href="https://bradshacks.com/Bin/SpecialCharacters.exe">download a precompiled version</a> that doesn't require AutoHotkey to run.

You can put it in <strong>%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</strong> (navigate to this quickly by running "shell:startup" in the Run box) to have it automatically run at Windows startup.

This is written in AutoHotkey 2.0 syntax.
'!' means Alt, '+' means Shift, '^' means Control, so '!a' means pressing 'Alt' and 'A' together.
